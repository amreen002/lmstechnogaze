                                <p>A Statement of Purpose (SOP) or essay provides a quick snapshot into a person's life. In today's world, whether you're applying for college or interviewing for a job, people want to hear your story. They are interested in your background, education, skills, experiences, and most importantly, your learnings. Crafting your story in a way that connects with the reader on an emotional level creates a lasting impression and sets you apart from the rest.</p>
                                <p>At TGSC, we see the SOP/essay as a celebration of your individual story. We appreciate your experiences, accomplishments, and achievements. Our goal is to help you become confident and proud of your journey, showcasing your unique story to the world.</p>
