                                  In the traditional Indian education system, large class sizes and rigid teaching methods 
make it nearly impossible for educators to cater to each student’s unique learning style. 
At TGSC, we bridge this gap by providing a personalised learning experience tailored to your

 ensuring they understand concepts in the way that suits them best.

                            <hr />
                            <p>
                            I have always been an average grade scorer, but my love for learning has never waned. From grade 6 in 
                            my ICSE school, we had separate subjects for biology, physics, and chemistry. My childhood was marked 
                            by an insatiable curiosity, always seeking the logic behind everything. My parents, recognizing my
                             inquisitiveness, believed I would thrive in these subjects. However, the Indian education system 
                             prioritized rote learning over understanding, leaving little room for satisfying a curious mind. 
                             Despite my efforts, I ended up scoring average marks.
                             </p>
 <p>
 In grade 8, during a parent-teacher meeting, my teachers bluntly told my parents, "She isn’t made for science; 
 she should opt for commercial studies in grade 9." Though my parents encouraged me to pursue science, believing in
  my potential, I was a sensitive teenager and the teachers’ words stung. I decided to drop science, convinced that 
  they were right. My parents, respecting my decision, didn’t pressurize me, trusting that I would eventually find my path.
  </p>
  <p>
 For grades 9 and 10, I studied commercial studies. Yet, when the time came to choose subjects for grade 11, I 
 found myself at another crossroads. I had assumed I would continue with commerce, but the teachers doubted my 
 aptitude for it. I didn’t enjoy commerce either; it lacked the curiosity and experimentation I craved. With limited 
 options, I chose humanities, drawn by my passion for history.
 </p>
  <p>
 In my heart, I believed I had finally found my calling and aimed to pursue economics. However, life had other plans.
  When I went to the USA for my undergraduate degree, I declared my major as Environment and Business Economics. The
   American curriculum required me to explore various subjects before settling on a major. I took science courses and, 
   to my astonishment, found them not only understandable but fascinating. Working part-time in labs, I discovered a newfound 
   clarity and retention in my studies. I graduated with a Bachelor of Science, cum laude.
   </p>
  <p>
 As I adapted my study habits to fit my learning style, my comprehension and retention improved dramatically. Concepts 
 that once seemed difficult became clear, and recalling information during exams became easier. My grades rose, boosting
  my confidence along with them. This experience made me reflect on my educational journey. Had my teachers not demotivated 
  me and instead focused on my learning style, I might have embraced science earlier.
  </p>
  <p>
 This realization inspired me to create The Good Student Co. Our mission is to help each child understand subjects in a way 
 that suits their unique learning style. We believe that every child doesn’t have to fit into a particular prototype to be 
 successful; their unique self is enough to reach the skies.
 </p>
  <p>
 This journey taught me the importance of leveraging my strengths and being adaptable. Understanding my learning
  preferences allowed me to study more effectively and efficiently, transforming my academic performance. The skills 
  and self-awareness I gained from this experience continue to benefit me, proving the lasting value of personalized 
  learning strategies.
